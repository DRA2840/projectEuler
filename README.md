# project Euler

This is my repository to post my solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems.

If you do not know [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net), you really should look their [website](http://projecteuler.net). 
It chalenges you with many math problems, and solving one of them prepares you to solve the next one. 
[This is the first one](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1). Do it. And then the next. And the next...

If you're stuck with a problem, do not look my answer, for two reasons: I'm starting, so I do not have many of them; 
And you should really take a walk, clear your mind, and then think about it again. 
Look out for algorithms that may help you, not for implementations. 

Finally yes, I like recursion. A lot. 
I'm training my mind to re-solve all of them using a functional language (probably Haskell) in the near future.
That's why all my answers are using recursion algorithms, even when there is a easier way to solve it using a loop. 
I only use loops when my algorithm is correct, but I get a StackOverflow Error, because Java can't handle really far recursions.
In these cases, I keep the recursive method and post the same algorithm with a loop.

Finally, thank you, Randall Munroe, I only found [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) because of a [post](http://blog.xkcd.com/2008/08/22/pi-con-math-gender-glaubama/) in your [blog](http://blog.xkcd.com/).
